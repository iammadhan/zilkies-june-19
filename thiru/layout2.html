            A little while before uttering these words, Haris Rauf had turned millions of viewers into his admirers - and completed an unusual journey that hinted at an emerging pathway for cricketers of the future. Playing just his fourth T20, the 24-year-old fast
            bowler had been given the ball with Karachi Kings needing 47 off the last four overs with seven wickets in hand. If the match between the two arch-rivals had been in the balance, it wasn't after his two-over spell of pace and late reverse-swing
            had claimed four wickets.With the fate of the match sealed, Rauf walked back to his fielding place for the final over, his gaze set at the Lahore Qalandars' dressing room, and kissed the team's emblem on his chest. It was more than just an
            ordinary portrayal of affection for the team. Rather, it was an acknowledgement of the role the franchise had played in his elevation from a street cricketer and part-time salesman to a PSL matchwinner in the space of two years.
