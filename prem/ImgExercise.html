        Far Cry is a franchise of first-person shooter video games, all of which have been published by Ubisoft. The
        first game, Far Cry, was developed by Crytek to premiere their CryEngine software, and released in March
        2004.Subsequently, Ubisoft obtained the rights to the franchise and the bulk of the development is handled by
        Ubisoft Montreal with assistance from other Ubisoftsatellite studios. The following games in the series have
        used a Ubisoft-modified version of the CryEngine,the Dunia Engine, allowing for open world gameplay.

        The Far Cry games, due to the history of their development, do not have any significant shared narrative
        elements, but instead share a theme of placing the player in a wilderness environment where they must help
        fight against one or more despots that control the region as well as surviving against wild animals that
        roam the open spaces. The Far Cry games feature a robust single-player campaign with later titles offering
        co-operative campaign support. The games also offer competitive multiplayer options and the ability for
        users to edit the games' maps for these matches.
